This is my first game I've ever made!
It was created using Java's built in JPanel, all of the sprites were designed by me.
The game consists of a rabbit who has a dream to jump to the top, as you climb away from earth collect carrots
to jump even higher! This game is a 2-d platformer and will be getting updated as I experiment and further my Java skills.
